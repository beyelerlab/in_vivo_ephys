# Project name

# Quick overview

Code written for the analysis of paper  [Dopamine transmission in the anterior insula shapes the neural coding of anxiety](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.25.620186v1).

This code written to analyse the electrophysiological data from the mouse brain. It analyse quantative analysis and dimensionality reduction technique(Principle component analysis) and deep learning tool[cebra](https://cebra.ai/docs/index.html). This code analyses data from two experimental setups: elevated plus maze(EPM) and sucrose quinine taste valence test.  

`EPM_PCA.ipynb`: Implement PCA 
`EPM_CEBRA.ipynb`: Implement CEBRA 
`SQ_PCA.ipynb`: Implement PCA 
`SQ_CEBRA.ipynb`: Implement CEBRA

Rest of the files are the helper functions used in the analysis.

# Getting started 

## Installation 

Clone the repository your local machine. 

Install the requirements.

Python version 3.8.18

## Hardware requirements 

# Demo 

### Input file structure 

These scripts assume that they are dealing with the preprocessed data. Usage instructions are already present in the begining of each jupyter notebook.

There is a data to use for testing the python scripts along with output folder of the expected outcome.
